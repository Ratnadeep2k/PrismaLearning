# Node.js ORM with Type Safety and Automatic Migrations

This project demonstrates how to use an ORM (like Prisma) with **TypeScript** to ensure **type safety** while keeping the Node.js code consistent and simple. It also provides automatic migrations and type-safe database queries.

## Features
- **Type Safety**: Queries are fully typed and errors are caught at compile-time.
- **Simple Queries**: Maintain clean and consistent code while querying the database.
- **Automatic Migrations**: Keep your database schema up to date with automatic migrations.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install prisma --save
